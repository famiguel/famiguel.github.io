I am Faye Anne Miguel from Kahului, Maui. Currently a junior in Shidler majoring in Marketing and hopefully double majoring in Management Information Systems.

In my past time, I love to go to local coffee shops, eat food, try food I never had before, and take photos. I also like to dance especially with my friends.

Originally, I came from the Philippines and moved to Maui, HI in 2013. I went to Maui High School and decided to move to University of Hawaii at Manoa to pursue a degree in Business.
