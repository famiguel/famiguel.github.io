<b> Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details </b>
The assignment was to create an e-commerce website which me and my partner decided to make a bracelet shop where customers can select quantity of bracelets they want to purchse, then they have to either log-in or sign up in order to checkout and see their invoice. https://github.com/famiguel/ITM352_F19_repo/tree/master/Miguel_Chou_Assignment2

<b> What did you learn from this assignment? </b>
I learned how to create a simple login and sign up page for my users. Me and my partner also learned that it's hard to go back and forth with the codes if it's not properly commented. So from now on, especially when we do the next assignment, we will comment every time we add something. 


<b> Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself). </b>
I worked with Mark Chou on this project and he did 50% and I did 50%. It's because we both live nearby at the dorms so we were able to give time on working on this project together. We would sit down and do the codes on his laptop then if we hit a wall, I would go on my own laptop to search up how to solve it. At the end, he sent the codes to me so we can doublecheck if it is working and we submitted it through my laptop.

<b> How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with? </b>
I got help through my partner, searching it up on the internet, or through our classmates.

<b> How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1? </b>
This assignment involves more things to put on server.js that confused me a little bit. But it was easy to start since we already have an existing site from assignment #1. Assignment #1 was really from scratch.

<b> Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging </b>
I feel like it was 30% of the time was spent on thinking on how to do something, 50% writing the code, and 10% testing and debugging.

<b> Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well? </b>
It really worked well having a partner because the code is double checked so we avoid too much debugging and testing. It also worked because my partner has his own strengths in doing the assignment such as debugging really fast, and I contributed in creativity. It also worked that we had the whole break to do the project. It's just a bad timing because my other classes also have so much requirements to do.

<b> If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently? </b>
I would've commented more throughout my code.
