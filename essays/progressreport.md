<b> My programming skills have greatly improved. </b>
Agree, I have used more CSS codes that made my website nicer. I also understand it more how to use different functions. It was really great to see the output of my hardwork on coding even if it was frustrating when it needs to be tested or debugged.

<b> I am enthusiastic about programming. </b>
Agree, I am enthusiastic about programming because it feels great to see the output of everything. It also brings out my creativity.

<b> I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions. </b>
Agree, I just try to do the practice WODs and re-do it if I take a while.

<b> The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence. </b>
Disagree, sometimes that labs makes me confused. Some are done through console and when I try to do it on coding itself, I don't understand how it works. So I end up searching it up or asking a classmate.

<b> I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications). </b>
Agree, This assignment makes me more excited to make my creation more complex.

<b> I think the class can be improved to help my learning. </b>
Agree, We need more in class time to do our labs and assignments so we can consult with the 2 professors, TAs, or our peers while doing it.

<b> There are things that work really well my learning in this class. </b>
Agree, I understand how websites work and I learn how to create them myself.
