BrowserHistory1 was easy but it took me around 23 minutes because I made a mistake on putting the photos. I downloaded the photos instead of putting the link. When I did it again, I was more familiar with it so I finished the WOD in 18 minutes. While doing this, I learned how to link internally where if I click Internet Explorer, it will take me to that area of the website.

BrowserHistory2 at first was confusing because I started putting links after the paragraphs not realizing I can put it in the words that relates to the link. Other than that, the right side of the page was too big and it took me a while to figure out was wrong. The first try was around 20 minutes, second was already Av for 14 minutes, and the last try was around 13 minutes because I gave up on how big the right portion of my webpage.

BrowserHistory3 was more interesting because I learned to do more things that I haven't done before. I was having a hard time to put the paragraphs in three columns. At first, the columns was really off until I rearranged the order of the paragraphs from left, center, and right to left, right, and center. It took me a lot of times to figure it out. The introduction is also going in to the 2nd and 3rd columns. I guess it's because of the huge space on the right side of the web page. I also learned how to make a navigation bar. My first trial took me around 22 minutes, second was around 18, and the third was at 16 minutes.

Among all the WODs, I didn't watch the screencast and just went in with what I have learned from the class or what I researched from the resources given on the ITM352 website. Maybe next time that I'm doing WODs, I'm going to watch the screencast available.
