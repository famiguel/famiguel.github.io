Eversince I was younger, I have always been curious at how things work and I like to explore troubleshooting even though I don't entirely know what I'm doing.
Now that I'm in college, using technology in my passion for business sounds like a good idea. I am currently in Marketing so double majoring in MIS would be great especially that the tech industry has been progressing.
After graduating with a dual major in Marketing and MIS, it would be useful to my advantage in finding a career.
